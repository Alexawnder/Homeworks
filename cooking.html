    <title>Chicken Tikka Masala</title>
    <h1>One of My Favorite Recipes</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Below is a dish that I have cooked a few times and its the Chicken Tikka Masala! This dish is very rich in flavor with the numerous spices that 
        all bring in different points to this dish that make it taste fantastic. From the searing of the chicken thighs which have been marinated in yogurt, to the creaminess that comes from adding in the heavy cream, 
        there are so many aspects to this dish which make it great. Below is a picture of the most recent one I have made and there are still definite improvements that I can make. The recipe comes from 
        a youtuber named Joshua Weissman, and here is a link to the video.
