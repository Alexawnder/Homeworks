        <h2>Pictures of Travels</h2>
        <p>
            Every few years, my family usually goes on a vacation for a few weeks either during winter or summer break. 
            <br>
            Below are some pictures below of France from this summer:

                    This is the Arc De Triomphe which was constructed in 1806 and is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France.
                    I remember seeing it and being surprised by the architecture and just the sheer size of it. Climbing all the way to the top was
                    definitely a workout but the view on top was definitely worth it.

        <h2>Cooking Food!</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> A big hobby that has taken over my life in my recent years has been cooking. It is something that I have grown to love to 
            do whenever I get the chance to. It brings me a lot of joy when I am able to cook for my friends and family and they are able to
            enjoy the meals that I create. I have grown from someone who has no knowledge of how to cook the most basic things to becoming a normal
            homecook. I was greatly inspired through watching many cooking videos from people such as Gordon Ramsey, Joshua Weissman, Uncle Roger, Maangchi, 
            and many more great chefs. Here are some pictures of recent recipes that I have created along with a link to a page with my favorite recipe that I have made 
            in the past few years. <a href="cooking.html">Favorite Recipe!</a>
