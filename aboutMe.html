            <h4>Brief Description About My Life</h4>
            Hello, my name is Alexander Lee and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona!
            I am from Temple City, California and I have lived here for my entire life. To start off let me give a brief backstory as to how I decided to major in Computer Science.
            As a kid, I was always unsure of what path to take and I had always thought that I would either go into engineering or becoming a doctor. When I got into highschool, I realized
            that becoming a doctor was a much more arduous task than I had thought after going through multiple career fairs and talking with people who were doctors. It made me think
            more about what I wanted to become, and I chose to begin learning coding in my Sophmore year of highschool since I had gained interest in it as I have played games my entire life. 
            This led to me joining the Software Team for my schools Robotics team and we were able to get top 3 in the state during my first year there. My junior and senior year, I ended up 
            becoming the Software Lead for the team but competitions were halted due to COVID-19 so I was only able to teach my teammates about the knowledge that I had gained my past year but we
            were unable to do any competitions but I was able to gain a lot from mentoring people about coding. Another thing that I did during highschool which also extended 
            into my first few college years was teaching students about how to code in Java and Scratch (Which is a simple block coding language made by MIT) and this helped me to gain 
            a much better understanding on how to deal with younger students and also increase my ability in coding. Overall these small decisions led to me making the choice to pursue Computer Science
            and currently I am working at an internship with LA city. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this LOL!
